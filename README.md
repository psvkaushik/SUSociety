# Sustainable Society

## Inspiration
As a team of sustainability enthusiasts, we were motivated to create an application that would encourage individuals to make more environmentally-conscious decisions in their daily lives. We recognized that sustainability can be a complex and overwhelming topic, and we wanted to simplify it by providing users with easy-to-follow suggestions and a community of like-minded individuals to support them on their journey.

## What it does
Our app, Sustainable Society, is designed to encourage sustainable living by providing users with a variety of challenges and recommendations that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Users can earn points by completing these challenges and engage with other users through social features, including commenting and sharing their progress. Points can be redeemed for a range of rewards, including discounts on sustainable products and donations to environmental organizations.

## How we built it
We built Sustainable Society as a web application using React and Flask and Mongodb for the backend. We also incorporated APIs, including the API to provide personalized recommendations based on the user's location and the API for reward redemption. 

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was ensuring that the app remained true to its core purpose of promoting sustainable living practices. We had to strike a balance between making the app fun and engaging, while also providing meaningful educational content and incentives for users to take sustainable actions.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the final product that we created, as it fulfills our initial vision and promotes sustainable living in a fun and engaging way. We also successfully APIs and implemented features, such as personalized recommendations and social features. 

## What we learned
Throughout the development process, we learned the importance of collaboration and communication when working on a team project. We also gained experience in developing web applications and working with APIs. Additionally, we learned about the diverse range of challenges associated with sustainability and the importance of making sustainable living accessible and approachable.

## What's next for Sustainable Society
We plan to integrate additional features, such as gamification elements and augmented reality experiences, to further engage our users. Finally, we plan to partner with more sustainability-focused organizations to promote Sustainable Society and support the global sustainability movement.
